# TDAmeritradeAPI
TDAmeritrade API Project; Created an automated daily downloader of all expirys of QQQ option chains (daily downloads scheduled via Windows Task Scheduler & using a batch file to target the proper script).

Will run ML modeling on Open Interest and other 'Greeks' once a good deal of data has been collected (likely after 2-3 months; Data Collection began 05-05-2022).
